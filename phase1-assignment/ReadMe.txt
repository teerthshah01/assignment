
Your assignment is to create a static (non-responsive) and functional web page as per the design (mockup.jpg) given to you, that
will display properly and consistently in the following browsers 

  Chrome
  Firefox 
  Edge

Note: Check whether your have all the above browsers. If not, download the missing browser ONLY from the official website. And 
check your webpage in all these browsers.


IMPORTANT: View your assignment in 100% zoom level (actual size), and then refer to it for dimensions and width-height etc.
Simply open the mockup in the browser and click on the image.

1. Layout
=========

Again, this is not a responsive page. You have to create a static (non-responsive) page layout. 
Refer to the mockup and use measuring tool and apply the same dimensions everywhere in your web page.

Note: We have Jruler tool for taking measurement. Ask for it.


2. Color
=========
Use a color picker browser extension to pick color from the mockup to apply the same color values in the CSS.

Suggested Chrome browser plugin: ColorZilla OR use one of your choice

3. Font
=======
1) Use google web font 'Inter' (regular 400, medium 500, bold 700).
Use 'embed' method to use the font. Do not use the font by using CDN link.

4. Code
=======
Avoid using random, careless naming in your CSS code. Let the naming be logical, and accurately descritive.
Take effort so that your code is readable. Apply code formatting, add comments in the code wherever necessary.



Before submitting assignment, make sure you have covered all the points in the following checklist.

Checklist
==========

1) Make sure that that your webpage looks like the mockup. Compare both closely
to make sure that there are no inconsistencies in terms of heigt-width, alignment, spacing, font-size, font-weight, line-heights, margins-paddings,  placement etc.

2) Let all the hyperlinks and buttons have visual states (hover, click, etc) defined on them.

3) All the images should be used in their actual dimensions. Do not try to modify dimensions of the images with css code.

4) Validate your HTML and CSS code before submitting. You must remove all the errors from your code. Give a good look at the warnings too. And see if you can resolve 'warnings' along with the errors.
